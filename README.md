# look-up [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/look-up.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/look-up)

> Like findup-sync and supports the same features but 20x-40x faster on avg.

## Install with [npm](npmjs.org)

```bash
npm i look-up --save
```

See the [benchmarks](#run-benchmarks) or [tests](./test.js).

## Usage

```js
var lookup = require('look-up');
lookup(pattern, {cwd: cwd, ...});
```

- `pattern` **{String|Array}**: glob pattern for the file to find
- `options` **{Object}**: options to pass to micromatch
    + `cwd` **{String}**: the directory to start looking (upwards) from


**Examples:**

```js
lookup('**/c/package.json', { cwd: 'fixtures/a/b/c/d/e/f/g' });
//=> 'fixtures/a/b/c/package.json'
```

Pass options to [micromatch]

```js
lookup('one.txt', { cwd: 'fixtures/a/b/c/d/e/f/g', matchBase: true });
//=> 'fixtures/a/b/c/d/one.txt'
```

## Running benchmarks

Install dev dependencies:

```bash
npm i -d && npm run benchmark
```

Benchmarks were run on [mac and windows](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/look-up/issues/1). look-up is 20-50x faster than [findup-sync] on avg.

```bash
#1: deep-close
  findup x 510 ops/sec ±2.09% (85 runs sampled)
  lookup x 50,059 ops/sec ±1.22% (89 runs sampled)
  (lookup is 98x faster)

#2: deep-far
  findup x 86.71 ops/sec ±2.28% (74 runs sampled)
  lookup x 53,252 ops/sec ±1.24% (91 runs sampled)
  (lookup is 614x faster)

#3: nested
  findup x 224 ops/sec ±2.05% (83 runs sampled)
  lookup x 42,676 ops/sec ±1.45% (92 runs sampled)
  (lookup is 191x faster)

#4: non-glob
  findup x 6,965 ops/sec ±1.98% (86 runs sampled)
  lookup x 92,749 ops/sec ±1.21% (95 runs sampled)
  (lookup is 13x faster)

#5: shallow
  findup x 148 ops/sec ±2.22% (73 runs sampled)
  lookup x 41,859 ops/sec ±1.42% (90 runs sampled)
  (lookup is 283x faster)
```

## Running tests
